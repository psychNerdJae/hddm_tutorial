# HDDM Tutorial

## Learning (H)DDM

If you're new to drift diffusion modeling (DDM), you can watch a short video lecture on the topic by [clicking here](https://youtu.be/jzsl69VGseU). The slides to this talk are also available in this repository (`Intro to DDM CPC Zurich 2021.pdf`).

You can find a conceptual overview of the model-fitting process in the slides entitled `Carney Modeling Workshop 2021 HDDM Demo.pdf`.

Sample code and additional self-learning material can be found in the Jupyter notebook entitled `hddm_tutorial_cpc_zurich_2021.ipynb`. In order to run this code, you will need to install HDDM.

## Installation notes

In this repository's [Wiki](https://github.com/psychNerdJae/hddm_tutorial_carney_workshop/wiki), you can find how-to guides for installing HDDM in various ways. If you're just playing around with HDDM, I highly recommend using Google Colab. If you're wanting to use HDDM for more intensive research purposes, I also have guides for installing HDDM on your personal computer or university's high-performance computing cluster. Please let me know if you see any errors that need correction.

## Additional resources

The HDDM GitHub page can be found [here](https://github.com/hddm-devs/hddm).

The [online documentation](http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/) is as good as a textbook.

If you need help, the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/hddm-users/) is very responsive.

Here are some example of studies I've run using HDDM:
