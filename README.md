# HDDM Tutorial

The HDDM GitHub page can be found [here](https://github.com/hddm-devs/hddm).  
The [online documentation](http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/) is as good as a textbook.  
If you need help, the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/hddm-users/) is very responsive.

Here are some example of studies I've run using HDDM (with scripts):  
Manuscript: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48050-2  
Data and scripts: https://osf.io/8ka47/

There are many how-to guides on this repo's [Wiki](https://github.com/psychNerdJae/hddm_tutorial_carney_workshop/wiki).  
These include guides for installing HDDM (on the cloud via Google Colab, on your personal machine, and on high-performance computing clusters). Please let me know if you see any errors that need correction.
